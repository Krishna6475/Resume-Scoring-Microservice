I explored LSTM and Prophet models and reduced RMSE by 12% compared to the baseline. Additionally, I conducted hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV and automated model pipelines using scikit-learn.\n\nAcademically, I have completed online certifications in 'Machine Learning' by Stanford University on Coursera and 'Deep Learning Specialization' by Andrew Ng. These courses provided a solid foundation in supervised learning, unsupervised learning, neural networks, and optimization techniques.\n\nBeyond coursework, I actively contribute to open-source ML repositories on GitHub and participate in Kaggle competitions, where I consistently rank in the top 20% in structured data challenges. I am also a part of the college AI club, where I mentor junior students in learning data science tools and best practices.\n\nI am familiar with tools such as Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, Git, and version control practices, and I have experience deploying ML models using Flask APIs and Streamlit dashboards.\n\nWith a solid academic foundation, strong technical skills, and a passion for learning, I am eager to apply my knowledge to real-world problems in a dynamic organization through a Machine Learning Internship.

My GitHub repository contains code for various ML algorithms and notebooks demonstrating my understanding of supervised and unsupervised learning methods. Additionally, I completed a research internship where I contributed to a project on anomaly detection using Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM. I collaborated with a small team, documented my findings, and presented results using Matplotlib and Seaborn. I am comfortable using tools such as Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, and VSCode. I have also begun learning TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning projects. Currently, I am working on a CNN-based project to classify chest X-ray images for detecting pneumonia. My communication and teamwork skills were enhanced through academic presentations and my participation in hackathons.
